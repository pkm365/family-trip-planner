That's an excellent idea! This would create a much more engaging and collaborative trip planning
  experience. Let me break down this concept:

  🎯 Activity Discovery & Voting System

  Core Flow:

  1. Search & Discovery → 2. Flashcard Creation → 3. Family Voting → 4. Showcase Display → 5.
  Drag-to-Schedule

  Detailed Implementation:

  1. Smart Search Function

  - Search Input: "restaurants in Osaka", "family activities Tokyo", "budget attractions Kyoto"
  - AI-Powered Recommendations: Use travel APIs (TripAdvisor, Google Places, Yelp) + AI to curate
  results
  - Filter Options: Budget range, category, distance from accommodation, family-friendly rating

  2. Interactive Flashcards

  3. Family Voting System

  - Comment System: Family members can add notes like "Too crowded" or "Perfect for kids"
  - Ranking System: Activities with highest votes bubble to top
  - Voting Analytics: See who voted for what

  4. Showcase in Daily Planner

  - Voted Activities Panel: Sidebar showing top-voted activities as draggable cards
  - Filter by Votes: Show only activities with 2+ votes, 3+ votes, etc.
  - Visual Indicators: Color-coded by vote count (gold for unanimous, silver for majority)
  - Smart Suggestions: "Based on your votes, you might also like..."

  5. Enhanced Drag-and-Drop

  - From Showcase to Schedule: Drag voted activities directly into time slots
  - Smart Scheduling: Auto-suggest optimal time based on activity type and location
  - Conflict Detection: Warn if dragging creates scheduling conflicts
  - Quick Actions: Right-click for "Schedule for tomorrow morning" shortcuts

  🎨 UI/UX Enhancements:

  New Pages/Sections:

  1. Discovery Hub - Search and browse recommendations
  2. Voting Dashboard - See all family votes and comments
  3. Activity Showcase - Beautiful grid of voted activities
  4. Enhanced Daily Planner - With showcase sidebar

  Visual Design:

  - Card-based Interface: Instagram-style activity cards
  - Voting Animations: Smooth heart animations, vote counters
  - Progress Indicators: "3 of 5 family members voted"
  - Photo Galleries: Swipeable image carousels for each activity

  🚀 Technical Implementation:

  Backend APIs:

  Frontend Features:

  🎯 User Journey Example:

  2. System shows: 12 beautiful flashcards with photos, ratings, descriptions
  3. Family votes: Dad ❤️ ramen place, Kids ❤️ themed café, Mom ❤️ traditional restaurant
  4. Showcase updates: Top 3 voted restaurants appear in daily planner sidebar
